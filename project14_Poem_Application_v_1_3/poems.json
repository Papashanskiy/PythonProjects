      "1\n\nO CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;\nThe ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:\nBut O heart! heart! heart!\nO the bleeding drops of red,\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\nFallen cold and dead.\n\n2\n\nO Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\nRise up-for you the flag is flung-for you the bugle trills;\nFor you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths-for you the shores a-crowding;\nFor you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\nHere Captain! dear father!\nThis arm beneath your head;\nIt is some dream that on the deck,\nYou've fallen cold and dead."

      "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\nPrevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum\nBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\n\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\nScribbling on the sky the message He is Dead.\nPut crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\nLet the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\n\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West,\nMy working week and my Sunday rest,\nMy noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\nI thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.\n\nThe stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\nPack up the moon and dismantle the sun,\nPour away the ocean and sweep up the woods;\nFor nothing now can ever come to any good."

      "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\nOnly this, and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;\nThis it is, and nothing more.\""
